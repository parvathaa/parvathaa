Hello 🌐, I'm Parvatha Varshini
📡 Cybersecurity student | 🖥️ SOC Analyst 

Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m currently a student @ The University of Manchester while building a solid cybersecurity foundation through labs, certifications, and hands-on projects. My mission is simple:
-> Defend systems. Detect threats. Stay ahead of adversaries.

🧭 My Journey
📚 Earned the CompTIA Security+, Google Cybersecurity Profesional Certification, and AZ-900 & SC-900 certifications to sharpen my cloud skills.
🛠️ Building homelabs featuring SIEMs, IDS/IPS, malware detection & analysis, and cloud security tools.
🎯 Goal: Transition into a SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Analyst role and grow toward Incident Response & Threat Hunting.
🔬 Current Projects
🍯Azure Cloud SOC Honeypot → Deployed a VM honeypot in Azure, forwarded logs to Log Analytics, and integrated Microsoft Sentinel for real-world attack.

⚔️ SOC Monitoring & Response Environment → SOC-like environment where I practice log analysis, scripting, SIEM queries, IDS/IPS alerts, and EDR concepts.

🧪 Red Team Simulation + Detection → Simulated attacker techniques and practiced defending in Splunk & Sentinel with real-world queries, responding like a SOC analyst.

🛠️ Tools & Skills I'm Building
SIEM & Detection: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel(KQL), Sysmon, AD logs
EDR/IDS: Snort, Suricata, Velociraptor
Scripting: Python, PowerShell, Bash
Cloud: Microsoft Azure
Vulnerability Scanning: OpenVAS, Nessus
Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
